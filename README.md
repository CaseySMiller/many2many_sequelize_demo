# Teaching aid for many-to-many relationships in sequelize

## What is it?
This is a backend-only app to demonstrate the different way to work with many-to-many relationships using sequelize and postgresSQL.

## How to use it
This is designed to be tested with a tool such as insomnia or postman to see how the routes work.

I will include an export file to import the test routes to insomnia inside of the /dev_assets/ folder.
